# Prosjekt-4_COVID

* It must be noted this is a group project apart of the MSc Course (Modeling and Computational Engineering: MOD510-1 20H).
* Special thanks to our Professor Aksel Hiorth: https://github.com/ahiorth. and my 2 group members: Einar Gramstad Salomonsen + Aleksander Storhaug Str√∏m.

This project focuses on modeling Covid-19 via a Monte-Carlo Random Walk Model. The simulation is based off of research performed
on the SEIRD model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, & Dead). We will be able to see the effects of implementing a 
quarantine, masks, and general human-human interaction which allows a disease such as Covid-19 to propogate amongst a given population.
